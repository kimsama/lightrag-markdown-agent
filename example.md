# The Solar System

The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The largest of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) and four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).

## The Planets

| Planet | Diameter (km) | Distance from Sun (million km) | Orbital Period (Earth days) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mercury | 4,879 | 57.9 | 88 |
| Venus | 12,104 | 108.2 | 225 |
| Earth | 12,742 | 149.6 | 365 |
| Mars | 6,779 | 227.9 | 687 |
| Jupiter | 139,820 | 778.5 | 4,333 |
| Saturn | 116,460 | 1,434 | 10,759 |
| Uranus | 50,724 | 2,871 | 30,687 |
| Neptune | 49,244 | 4,495 | 60,190 |

## Mercury

Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the Sun of 87.97 days is the shortest of all the planets. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.

## Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It's one of the four inner, terrestrial planets, and it's often called Earth's twin because of their similar size and mass.

## Earth

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, making it the "Blue Planet".

## Mars

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System. Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.

## Jupiter

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets combined.

## Saturn

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.
